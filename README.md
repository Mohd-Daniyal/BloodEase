- Admins can view, update, and delete donor information.
- Admins can view, update, and delete patient information.
- Admins can view donation requests made by donors and can approve or reject those requests based on the donor's health status.
- If a donation request is approved by an admin, the donated unit of blood is added to the blood stock of the corresponding blood group.
- If a donation request is rejected by an admin, no units of blood are added to the stock.
